## List of Practicals
1. Write a program for implementing a  MINSTACK  which should support operations like push, pop, overflow, underflow, display
Construct a stack of N-capacity
Push elements 
Pop elements
Top element 
Retrieve the min element from the stack

2. Write a program to deal with real-world situations where Stack data structure is widely used
         Evaluation of expression:
                                      Stacks are used to evaluate expressions, especially in languages that use postfix or prefix notation. Operators and operands are pushed onto the stack, and operations are performed based on the LIFO principle.


3. Write a program for finding (NGE) NEXT GREATER ELEMENT from an array


4. Write a program to design a circular queue(k) which Should implement the below functions 
    Enqueue 
    Dequeue
    Front 
    Rear

5. Write a Program for an infix expression, and convert it to postfix notation. Use a queue to implement the Shunting Yard Algorithm for expression conversion.

6. Write a Program for finding the Product of the three largest Distinct Elements. Use a Priority Queue to efficiently find and remove the largest elements

7. Write a Program to Merge two linked lists(sorted)

8. Write a Program to find the Merge point of two linked lists(sorted)
