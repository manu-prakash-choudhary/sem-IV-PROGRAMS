# What are Hash Functions and How to choose a good Hash Function?

# What is a Hash Function? 

# A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values.  
# The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.

# What are the properties of a good hash function?
# 1. Deterministic: The same input should always produce the same hash value.
# 2. Fast computation: The hash function should be fast to compute.
# 3. Uniform distribution: The hash function should produce a uniform distribution of hash values.
# 4. Less collisions: The hash function should produce the least number of collisions.
# 5. Less memory: The hash function should use less memory.
# 6. Less computation: The hash function should use less computation.
# 7. Less storage: The hash function should use less storage.
# 8. Less time: The hash function should use less time.

# What are the types of hash functions?
# 1. Division-remainder method - The simplest method is to use the remainder of the division of the key by the table size as the hash value.
# 2. Multiplication method - The multiplication method is similar to the division method, but it uses multiplication instead of division.
# 3. Mid-square method - The mid-square method squares the key and extracts the middle portion of the result as the hash value.
# 4. Folding method - The folding method divides the key into equal-sized pieces and adds the pieces together to form the hash value.

# What are the applications of hash functions?
# 1. Cryptography: Hash functions are used in cryptography to secure data.
# 2. Data storage: Hash functions are used to store data in hash tables.
